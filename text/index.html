I am waiting for my case to come up<br>   
and I am waiting<br> 
for a rebirth of wonder<br> 
and I am waiting for someone<br> 
to really discover America<br> 
and wail<br> 
and I am waiting<br>   
for the discovery<br> 
of a new symbolic western frontier<br>   
and I am waiting<br>   
for the American Eagle<br> 
to really spread its wings<br> 
and straighten up and fly right<br> 
and I am waiting<br>
for the Age of Anxiety<br> 
to drop dead<br>
and I am waiting<br>
for the war to be fought<br> 
which will make the world safe<br>
for anarchy<br> 
and I am waiting<br> 
for the final withering away<br> 
of all governments<br> 
and I am perpetually awaiting<br> 
a rebirth of wonder<br> <br> <br> 
I am waiting for the Second Coming<br>    
and I am waiting<br>  
for a religious revival<br>  
to sweep thru the state of Arizona<br>    
and I am waiting<br>  
for the Grapes of Wrath to be stored<br>    
and I am waiting<br>  
for them to prove<br>  
that God is really American<br>  
and I am waiting<br>  
to see God on television<br>  
piped onto church altars<br>  
if only they can find<br>    
the right channel<br>    
to tune in on<br>  
and I am waiting<br>  
for the Last Supper to be served again<br>  
with a strange new appetizer<br>  
and I am perpetually awaiting<br>  
a rebirth of wonder.<br>

<p>
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, <br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand <br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame <br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name <br>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand <br>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command <br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. <br>
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she <br>
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, <br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, <br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”<br>
