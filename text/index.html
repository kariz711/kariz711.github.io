<p>
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, <br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand <br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame <br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name <br>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand <br>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command <br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. <br>
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she <br>
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, <br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, <br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”<br>
