	In my project, I collected discarded letter press type for my collection. I used the lead pieces to print and showcase their imperfections. I wanted to give a new life to something that had been discarded because of continuous use (and misuse). I paired in with the lyrics of "Haunted" to express the emptiness of being unwanted. The words are covered pictures of the type itself from a different perspective, further exploring the imperfections of the Hell Box type.
