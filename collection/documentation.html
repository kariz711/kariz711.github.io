	In my project, I collected discarded letter press type for my collection. I used the lead peices to print and showcase their imperfections. I wanted to give a new life to something that had been discarded because of continuous use (and missuse). I paired in with the lyrics of "Haunted" to express the emptyness of being unwanted. The ords are covered pictures of the type itself from a diffrent perspective, further exploring the imperfections of the Hell Box type.
