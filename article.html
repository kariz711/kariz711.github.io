Ask a designer or artist if any aspect of their process is random. The answer will likely reveal a complex relationship between human cognition, digital media, authorship, and even conceptions of reality and the divine. For those of us who work in computational media to make art, the question can be even more focused: When and why do you use a “random()” function when you write code?

Randomness is not a new concept. For example, a method for random selection–essentially drawing one lot from many out of a helmet–is explained in Homer’s Iliad. Even in pre-Newtonian 17th-century discourse relating chance, cause, and necessity, a distinction was made between events which appeared to be random–but merely being unpredictable–and events which were truly random.

This philosophical inquiry raised metaphysical questions about human agency in the word. Even today, with science settled on the definition of randomness as a non-repeating, non-biased, non-patterned sequence of values, our assumptions about chance, cause, and effect often conflict with the facts.

Random occurrences can be easily found in nature. Randomness within the closed system of a digital computer, however, in which all the forces are known and quantifiable, suddenly becomes elusive. For this reason, random number generating functions in computer languages are said to yield “pseudo-random” rather than “true-random” results. Pseudo-random values are generated, by a mathematical series of operations performed to produce a sequence of numbers that repeat with a long enough period to be effectively random, that is, free of pattern or bias. A “seed” serves as the initial value or starting point in the series. Many people are surprised to learn that pseudo-random numbers are entirely determined by the initial seed value and are therefore completely predictable, if you know the algorithm, and repeatable, if you know the seed. Often the default seed value for a pseudo-random number generator is something like the current time converted to a number. This allows even the first few values of the sequence to be different from one run of the program to the next.

The applications of randomness in statistics, computer science, finance, and mathematics are well established, but less so in art and design.
