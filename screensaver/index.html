Last seven years 
I felt so wanted 
Now I’m a house 
Broken and haunted 

The wind she laughs 
She eats my bowels and breaks my back 
Are you still here? 
Do you still want me? 

Give me a sign 
Does your heart still beat? 
Wore out my spine on the 
Sharp edge of my seat 

Please tell me what’s your name 
I’ve been thinking 
Things haven’t been the same 
Since you came back with all of these 
Ghosts in your eyes 
They dance and glow and grin and glide 
Look up at me 
Can’t you see? 
I’m alive and on my knees 

I remember those days giving candy to the insects in the park 
You handed me the last piece when I told you that we’d never be apart 
Yesterday I went back, they were eating out the pieces of your heart 

There was time for us 
There was time 
Back then there was time for us 
Yes there was time…

Saw you giving signals from the plate 
Movement of your fingers make me tingle make me shake 
Sunday shining through your eyes 
Caught my little heart between your thighs 
Right then I knew you were my 

Dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream catcher 

Oh how I stalked your hips 
Mustard running down, I licked my lips 
Foul ball in the air 
You jumped into the crowd 
And as the umpire yelled “out” 
I swear I’ve never felt so proud 
‘Cause you’re my one and only 

Dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream catcher 

When darkness creeps into my brain 
And I want everyone to die 
I grab your jersey and I squeeze it tight and drink of it 
I love the bitter stink of it 

And slowly I begin to rise 
Watch me flashing through the sky 
Oh catch me catch me as I fly 
But will I ever catch your eye? 

And when I watch you on the field 
Everybody knows 
I just want to take you wake you 
I just want to rip your clothes off 
When I watch you on the field 
Everybody knows 
I just want to take you wake you 
I just want to rip your clothes off

I spent my night shooting stars in their beds 
Bleeding my wishes through holes in their heads 
Voices rang out as I sprouted and spread 
Won’t you speak to me speak to me speak to me dead 

Coughing my coffin's asleep on the shore 
Tongues on my lungs flapping caught in a door 
Trickling trumpets won't trickle no more 
Once they slit through my slit to my slit through my core 

Rabid as rabbits sprung out from the lab 
Frightening the lightning and fondling the scabs 
Everyone's panicking, everyone's glad 
'Cause it's good to be good to be good to be mad 

Pass me the scalpel I'm going inside 
Gonna get lost in the soft of my bride 
If I don’t get back she’d something to hide 
So she stabbed through my stabbed through my stabbed through my pride 

I spent my night shooting stars in their beds 
Bleeding my wishes through holes in their heads 
Voices rang out as I sprouted and spread 
Won’t you speak to me speak to me speak to me dead

Honey lately i know I’ve been cruel 
Like some kind of witch some kind of vampire 
Like some kind of monster some kind of fool 

And yes i know it won’t be easy 
Yes i know it won’t be easy 
I’ve done you wrong 

So i packed my parrot and my bags 
Took the first raft out of town 
Now I’m here alone 
On this island made of bones 
Just praying for my death to be slow 

‘Cause honey you were my last chance at love 
My last chance at love 
Honey you were my last chance at love 

I dreamt about church the other day 
I said father, father, what the hell can i say? 
Except I let my man get away 

And now I know it won’t be easy 
Yes i know it won’t be easy 

‘Cause honey you were my last chance at love 
My last chance at love 
Honey you were my last chance at love 

Once i was down 
Half my head sunk on the ground 
I thought that i had lost you 
I punished myself daily for the past 
My little mind spent most years in a cast 

Back then i was lost 
I was looking at the cost of what i had done to you 
Could hardly open my eyes 
Spent my heavy days so high 
So high up in the sky 

But you were never gone you were never gone 
‘Cause i was always on my own 
And well now look at you you’ve never looked so true 
So truly blue 

Ta tarara tarara tara tara tara tarata tata....

"Pinc Louds" is the first EP by the NYC-based, "primal acoustic doo-wop" trio, Pinc Louds. Recorded one year after the band was formed, the EP captures the unique sense of redemption and confusion that made Pinc Louds' live performances a sought out destination for the giddy, the needy and the unemployed. Combining puppets and post-its, poodles and post-trauma it is a triumphant parable of strife and self-determination. Throughout the record's five tracks, Claudi screams and whispers her myths, fairytales, recipes and wifi passwords, with a sweet and raspy voice that she promises “will lead you through the tortuous paths of my inner living room, a world where cockroaches fly, butterflies fish, and sometimes, milk and cookies are served.”
All songs written by Claudi. Except for “Haunted” written by Claudi and Sebastián Castrodad. 
Pinc Louds is: Claudi (Vocals, guitar, piano, ominchord, harmonies); Ofer Bear (Bass and additional vocals on track 5); Rai Mundo (drums, percussion, additional vocals on track 5). Additional synthesizers by Hani Zahra on track 4. 
All songs recorded and mixed at Machete Sisters by Hani Zahra and mastered by Dave Darlington. 
Album art design by Claudi.
