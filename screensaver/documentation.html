	My screensaver uses lyrics from the band Pinc Louds on top of a video of Shia LaBeouf imposed on different videos related to what he says. I was limited to what I knew. Shia’s speech is automatically audible, whereas the soundtrack that accompanies the lyrics are optional to play. I decided to have the text move in different directions and speeds to create texture while still keeping them all the same style so they blend together and can be read different ways. Instead of having one some at a time, each line is a song and because they move differently, can be paired an infinite amount of ways in conjunction with the other text passing. Similarly, some text moves right so the text appears from the end of the song to the beginning. I used a roach as the cursor as a reference to the song “Roaches in my Hair” from the band.
